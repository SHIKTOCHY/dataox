      <h3>Excessive use</h3>

    <p>Users of the site are required to be considerate in their use. This
       means that:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>You shall not perform excessively intensive or frequent queries
          against the SPARQL endpoint.</li>
      <li>Where you are using a non-browser user-agent, the User-Agent header
          should include details of your application, including contact details
          (e.g. an e-mail or web address), so that we can contact you if we
          feel you are — intentionally or otherwise — being excessive in your
          use of the site.</li>
      <li>Where you distribute software that makes requests of the site, you
          should be confident that the software will not perform excessive
          requests.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We understand that our use of <em>excessive</em> is rather vague. We
       reserve the right to rate-limit or block clients that we determine to
       be excessive, or are having a detrimental effect on the service
       provided to other users.</p>
