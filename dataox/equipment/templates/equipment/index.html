  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the University of Oxford's research facilities and equipment
     on-line searchable database which has been developed with funding from
     <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a>. The purpose of this database
     is to provide information on research
     equipment over £10K and on the University’s Small Research Facilities
     (SRFs) and to promote and encourage the sharing of equipment across the
     University.</p>

  <p>You can search for a piece of equipment using only the free text search
     field below, do an advanced search where you can refine by general
     location and or browse by <a href="{% url browse %}">category</a>
     or <a href="{% url facilities %}">facility</a>.</p>

  <p>If you would like to add or amend an entry, please see the Contribute
     page. For all other queries please see the Contact page.</p>
