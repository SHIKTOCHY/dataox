Overview of the Service
=======================

The Open Data Service exists to make available :term:`linked data` about the
`University of Oxford <http://www.ox.ac.uk/>`_. These data can then be re-used
by consumers both within and without the University to integrate into services
that require institutional data, and aggregated to provide cross-institutional
services.

Scope
-----

We're primarily concerned with *public or university-internal* *institutional data*;

* data to which the public can be granted access (it is non-sensitive, e.g. which is already published on University websites), or
* which may may be accessed without restriction by members of the University

and which:

* is relevant to planning, managing, operating, or auditing a major administrative function of the university, or
* is required for use by more than one organizational unit.
