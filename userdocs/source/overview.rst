Overview of the Service
=======================

The Open Data Service exists to make available :term:`linked data` about the
`University of Oxford <http://www.ox.ac.uk/>`_. These data can then be re-used
by consumers both within and without the University to integrate into services
that require institutional data, and aggregated to provide cross-institutional
services.
