OxPoints
========

OxPoints aims to provde full and accurate geolinking information for the
University of Oxford.

The OxPoints dataset consists of names, postal addresses, web addresses and
co-ordinates (latitude and longitude) for all the departments, colleges and
other buildings/units of the University, along with some of the relationships
between them.

The intent is that these data be usable in a wide variety of ways, from simple
address queries to more complex maps and mash-ups.


Bespoke API
----------

There is a bespoke OxPoints API `documented on the IT Services website
<http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxpoints/index.xml?ID=body.1_div.3>`_.

This API doesn't expose any of the data in other datasets hosted through the
Open Data Service, but does provide the following additional features:

* You don't need to understand SPARQL to use it
* Time-based queries
* More serialization formats (e.g. KML)
